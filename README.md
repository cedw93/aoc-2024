# Advent of Code 2024

## Disclaimer

As per the [Request of the AoC Author](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) puzzle inputs and/or samples have **not** been provided within this repository however, each of the puzzle solutions should work if you fetch input from [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) yourself.

All solutions worked for my inputs, there maybe inputs with edge cases that are not satisfied as there are a large number of input values.

## Running

Each solution takes the puzzle's input from `stdin` and you can run using:

```
cd <day>
go run main.go < <filename>
```

It should produce an output for **both** part1 and part2 for that day's solution + how long it took to execute. An example output for `day20` would be

```
$ cd d20 && go run main.go < input.txt
Part One: <READACTED>
Part Two: <READACTED>
took 108.312125ms
```
